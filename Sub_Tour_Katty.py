#In this example, we create a Gurobi model and define the problem data, including the number of nodes n, the number of vehicles m, the capacity of the vehicles Q, the distance matrix c, and the demand for each node d.

#We define a set of binary variables x[i, j, k] that represent whether a vehicle k travels from node i to node j. We also define a set of binary variables y[i, k] that represent whether node i is visited by vehicle k.

#We add an objective function that minimizes the total cost of the routes, which is the sum of the distances traveled by each vehicle.
